# Plan: Verify Sanity API Tokens

Two Sanity token notifications were received. These are security-related and should be verified.

## Emails Referenced
1. Token added to project **temple_0_new** (label: template_0) - Jan 19, 2025
2. Token added to project **testmockapi** (label: token) - Jan 13, 2025

## Action Items

- [ ] Log into Sanity.io dashboard
- [ ] Verify both tokens were added by you (Mrym Rashid)
- [ ] If unrecognized, revoke the tokens immediately
- [ ] Review project access permissions
- [ ] Archive these emails after verification

## Notes
- Both tokens were added by the account owner, likely legitimate
- No immediate threat if you recognize these actions
