## Post Content

Just hit a major milestone in my AI automation journey! 🚀

Over the past few days, I've been building a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent) - an autonomous AI employee that runs 24/7 using Claude Code and Obsidian.

What's working now:
✅ Gmail monitoring with automatic email processing
✅ File system watchers for instant task detection
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval workflows for sensitive actions
✅ Comprehensive daily briefings and system health monitoring
✅ Structured planning engine that breaks down complex tasks

The breakthrough? Moving from reactive ("do this task") to proactive ("I noticed this and drafted a plan").

Cost comparison that got me excited:
• Traditional assistant: $4,000-8,000/month
• This AI employee: ~$500-2,000/month
• Nearly 90% cost reduction 📉

What I learned:
1. Local-first architecture keeps your data private
2. Approval workflows are essential for trust
3. The hardest part isn't the AI - it's designing the right processes

Next up: Building an MCP server for LinkedIn automation (yes, this post will eventually be automated!)

For anyone building with Claude Code - the future of work is hybrid: human strategy + AI execution.

What automation are you building in 2026?

Alternative CTA options:
1. "What automation are you building in 2026?" (current - open-ended)
2. "Drop a comment if you want to see the architecture breakdown" (promises future content)
3. "Who else is experimenting with autonomous AI agents?" (community building)
